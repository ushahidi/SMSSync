	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			SMSsync uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> protocols for communication.<br />
			To start the SMSsync Gateway, you'll need to specify a Sync URL. This URL is where all incoming SMS will be transmitted to. Remember to enter the full URL including the filename. A typical example will be <code>http://somedomain.com/index.php</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			For security you can specify a secret key to be sent to the Sync URL. If the secret key doesn't match on the server, the Sync URL can ignore the transmission.
		</li>
		<li>
			Additionally, you can specify keywords with which to filter incoming SMS. Only matching messages will be forwarded to the SMSsync Gateway URL.
		</li>
		<li>
			SMSsync uses the following variables to transmit the incoming SMS via the POST method:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>from</strong> -- the number that sent the SMS</li>
				<li><strong>message</strong> -- the SMS sent</strong></li>
				<li><strong>message_id</strong> -- the unique ID of the SMS</li>
				<li><strong>sent_to</strong> -- the phone number registered on the SIM card otherwise it's the value set on the app as device ID</li>
				<li><strong>secret</strong> -- the secret key set on the app</li>
                <li><strong>device_id</strong> -- the unique id set on the device to be used by the server to identify which device is communicating with it. Note: supported from v2.6.1 and above </li>
				<li><strong>sent_timestamp</strong> -- the timestamp the SMS was sent. In the UNIX timestamp format</strong></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>
In order for SMSsync to ensure perfect transmission, the Sync URL must return a JSON-formatted status message, as shown below.
<br /><br />
<strong>Succeeded</strong>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
{
    "payload":
    {
        "success": true,
        "error": null
    }
}</pre>
<br /><br />
<strong>Failed</strong>
<br />
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
{
    "payload":
    {
        "success": false,
        "error": "error message from the server"
    }
}</pre>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Response from server</strong>
<p>
SMSsync allows either an auto-response message to be configured on the app itself, or to be retrieved from the server. When the app makes an HTTP Post request to sync the incoming SMS to the configured URL, the server can respond with JSON-encoded messages alongside the success message. The app then sends these messages by SMS to the specified users phone.
</p>
<p>
This makes it possible to have an instant response via SMS when an HTTP Post request is made. To leverage this feature, a JSON formatted string like the one below needs to be returned by the configured URL in response to the app's HTTP Post request.
</p>
<p>
In the app itself, ensure <strong>*Get Reply from Server*</strong> is checked to enable this feature.
<p>
<strong>Response JSON data from the Sync URL</strong>

    "payload": {
        "success": "true",
        "task": "send",
        "messages": [
            {
                "to": "+000-000-0000",
                "message": "the message goes here",
                "uuid": "042b3515-ef6b-f424-c4qd"
            },
            {
                "to": "+000-000-0000",
                "message": "the message goes here",
                "uuid": "026b3515-ef6b-f424-c4qd"
            },
            {

            }
        ]
    }
}</pre>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Task</strong>
<p>
SMSsync supports execution of tasks defined on the server. Currently it supports sending of messages sent from the Sync URL as SMS. This feature is targeted towards developers. The app can be configured to poll the server for new tasks at a given frequency. The server then needs to respond to HTTP GET requests with <code>?task=send</code> (for example <code>http://callback_url/smssync?task=send</code>). The format of this response is shown below.
</p>
<br /><br />

                "uuid": "042bf515-eq6b-f424-c4pz"
            },
            {

                "message": "the message goes here",
                "uuid": "042b3515-ef6b-f424-c4qd"
            }
        ]
    }
}</pre>

<br /><br />

<strong>Notes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The secret key provided by the server must match the secret key configured within SMSsync, otherwise SMSsync will not execute the task.
</li>
<li>
To ensure the message is sent to the correct recipient, add the country code to the phone number. Eg. <strong>+254</strong>700709142. Without this, the message is sent to the number in the country where the phone is.
</li>
<li>
The web service should check the value of the secret key passed with each task request that SMSsync makes to it for messages to send and respond appropriately to ensure that not any instance of SMSsync can communicate with it.
</li>
</ul>
<a name="message-results"><strong>Message Results API</strong></a>
<p>Message Results API is a way to get SMS status delivery report back to the server so the server knows that messages have been
    successfully sent to their respective recipients or not.</p>
<p>This feature is supported on v2.7 and above. To make use of this feature, you have to enable the <code>Message Results API</code> and <code>SMS Delivery Report</code> from the Settings screen.</p>
<p>SMSsync will periodically send a Task request to the server for messages to send as SMS. <strong>Note:</strong> The server needs to include a unique ID for the messages in the JSON response as <code>"uuid":"unique_id"</code> key. See below for a sample JSON response from the server</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
GET /smssync?task=send HTTP/1.1
Host: testserver.local

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.5.2
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
    "payload": {
        "task": "send",
        "secret": "secret_key",
        "messages": [
            {
                "to": "+000-000-0000",
                "message": "the message goes here"
                "uuid": "aada21b0-0615-4957-bcb3"
            },
            {
                "to": "+000-000-0000",
                "message": "the message goes here"
                "uuid": "1ba368bd-c467-4374-bf28"
            },
            {
                "to": "+000-000-0000",
                "message": "the message goes here"
                "uuid": "95df126b-ee80-4175-a6fb"
            }
        ]
    }
}</pre>
Once SMSsync receives messages to be sent as SMS it will make a <code>POST ?task=sent</code> request with the message UUIDs as below to the server to acknowledge that it has received the messages
and has queued them up for processing.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
POST /smssync?task=sent HTTP/1.1
Host: testserver.local

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
    "queued_messages": [
        "aada21b0-0615-4957-bcb3",
        "1ba368bd-c467-4374-bf28",
        "95df126b-ee80-4175-a6fb"
    ]
}</pre>
<p>Next, the server needs to process the JSON response sent by SMSsync. It needs to remove all the message UUIDs sent by SMSsync from
the subsequent outgoing messages list so SMSsync avoids processing those again. Once the server receives the UUIDs of the queued up messages, it needs to send a response
back to SMSsync as JSON response with the received messages UUIDs as JSON array. If there are no received messages UUIDs, it needs to send back an empty JSON array to SMSsync</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
POST /smssync?task=sent HTTP/1.1
Host: testserver.local

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
    "message_uuids": [
        "aada21b0-0615-4957-bcb3",
        "1ba368bd-c467-4374-bf28",
        "95df126b-ee80-4175-a6fb"
    ]
}</pre>
<p>To send SMS status delivery report back to the server, SMSsync will make a <code>GET ?task=results</code> to the server and should receive a list
of message UUIDs that are waiting to receive delivery reports. The server should send the JSON response below</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
POST /smssync?task=results HTTP/1.1
Host: testserver.local

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
    "message_uuids": [
        "aada21b0-0615-4957-bcb3",

        "95df126b-ee80-4175-a6fb"
    ]
}</pre>
<p>Then SMSsync will send delivery reports for the message uuids above as a POST request<code>POST ?task=results</code> with the JSON response below</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">

 Assuming you've the above code saved in a file called demo.php and is located at your web server's document root, you can issue the command below to test.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    $ curl -D - -X POST http://localhost/demo.php \
        -F "from=09048370465" \

For a complete web service application, look at Ushahidi's <a href="https://github.com/ushahidi/Ushahidi_Web/tree/master/plugins/smssync">SMSsync plugin</a> which utilizes most of SMSsync's features.
</p>
<p>
There is also SMSsync webservice for Django that implements most of the features. You can download it from <a href="https://github.com/cwanjau/SMSsync-Python-Django-webservice">GitHub.com</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cwanjau">Caine Wanjau</a>

    <a name="alerts"><strong>Alerts</strong></a>
    <p>As of v2.7 and above, you should be able to query for the status of the device running SMSsync with query codes. For example, if you want to know if the device can still reach the web server, just text @20 to the device and you should receive a text message back with the status of the server.</p>
    Below are the query codes supported at the moment.
