## Development

If you would like to contribute code to SMSSync you can do so by forking the [repository][1] and sending a pull request. We will review your code. If everything with the pull request looks good, we will humbly merge your changes.

### Branch structure

The repository is made up of three main branches: **master (stable)**, **develop (ustable)** and **release (quite stable and a temporary branch)**.

* **master** has the latest stable code, it`s tags are released as [SMSSync][1] on the Google playstore.
* **develop** has the latest unstable code. It`s codes are merged into master.
* **release** is a branch of develop after feature freeze. mainly for fine tuning and testing to get the code stable for a release. The changes made here are finally merged into develop then develop is merged into master branch. After which a version tag is created for a release.

Always, work with the `develop` branch.
