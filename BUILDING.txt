The build setup here supports Android Studio and the new Gradle build system.
To build this project make sure you've either set ANDROID_HOME to point to where
you have your Android SDK installed or you have defined the location of the Android
SDK in the local.property file. In local.property file, make sure `sdk.dir` equals
 to the location of the Android SDK.

### Example on how to setup local.properties file
Create a local.properties file in the root of the project and insert the absolute path where you have
your sdk stored. Eg. sdk.dir=/home/username/android-sdk-linux_x86

### Build the app
./build.sh
